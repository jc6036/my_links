# Topics to Learn
These are a collection of topics about Computer Science, both essential (for all programmers interested in furthering their knowledge) and those that personally interest me.  

## The Essentials
Those things that I think advanced programmers should get a grip on.  
### Algorithms
### Data Structures
### Problem Theory
### Complexity Theory
### Software Design Methods and Patterns
### Web Servers
### Front-End Web Development
### Network Programming
### Parallel Programming
### Database Design and Management

## The Extras
Those things that I personally like to have a grip on, though they aren't essential to my education.  
### Linear Algebra
### Calculus
### Lambda Calculus
### Concrete Mathematics
### Computation Theory
### History of Computation
### Hardware Design
### Electrical Engineering
### Compiler Construction
### Programming Language Design
### Operating System Design
### Cyber Security
### Mobile Development
### User Interface Design
### Usability Design
### Machine Learning
### Distributed Computing


I believe that it's possible to have a generalized knowledge of all of these things while focusing on a few as a specialty. That is my goal, with computer science both as a hobby and a career.
