# Topics to Learn
These are a collection of topics about Computer Science, both essential (for all programmers interested in furthering their knowledge) and those that personally interest me.  

## The Essentials
Those things that I think advanced programmers should get a grip on.  
### Algorithms
[Algorithms 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/032157351X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3H1VA8G9Y8XH1&coliid=I1YLIPQEP1KJPE) is a good starting point for this sort of thing. For many, it's all they'll really need. Also details multiple types of data structures as well as algorithms.  
### Data Structures
See [this book.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/032157351X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3H1VA8G9Y8XH1&coliid=I1YLIPQEP1KJPE)  
### Computation Theory
[MIT Opencourseware.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2006/index.htm) Covers complexity theory, problem theory, and the general theory of computation.  
### Software Design Methods and Patterns
There are many, many books on software design methods and patterns.  
[See this book](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491681893&sr=8-1&keywords=design+patterns+elements+of+reusable+software) for design patterns. Other pieces of software design wisdom can be found in blog posts, text books, wikipedia articles, TED Talks, and so on. There are too many sources of information on this to list, but you will definitely run into some at some point.   
### Network Programming
[Knowledge about network programming](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) can be essential. It involves sending and receiving communications to and from a server or other device on the network or over the internet.  
### Parallel Programming
Parallel programming is becoming relatively common in the computing world, but there's still not a whole lot on it. Your best bet is to google for tutorials with whatever language you're using. If you're looking to get into low-level parallel computing, most definitely learn assembly and look into processor architecture concerning utilizing multiple cores. Language documentation normally includes docs on how to use the parallel programming part of the standard library for the language, this is invaluable.  
  
All that being said, there are still some pitfalls and rules common to all parallel computing attempts. So far the best resource I've found is [this](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~qstout/parallel.html). Read it, then follow the links at the bottom of the page. And good luck.  
### Database Design and Management
[This book](https://www.amazon.com/Murachs-Server-Developers-Training-Reference/dp/1890774693/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491682780&sr=8-1&keywords=SQL+Server+2012+textbook) is an excellent introduction to get you up to an intermediate level of skill with SQL databases. It's probably all you'll need as a programmer. However, if you wish to become a database admin professional, your best bet is to get certified. Something like the [MSCE: Data Platform Cert](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcse-sql-data-platform.aspx) would be a good bet for most areas of the United States, as would something like the [MSCE: SQL Server Business Intelligence Cert](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcse-sql-business-intelligence.aspx). You might also want to look into certs from other large cert-providers such as Cisco and CompTIA.

## The Extras
Those things that I personally like to have a grip on, though they aren't essential to my education.  
### Linear Algebra
[Khan Academy has it.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)  
### Calculus
[Khan Academy has it.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home)  
### Lambda Calculus
[This](https://www.utdallas.edu/~gupta/courses/apl/lambda.pdf) should be a good start. After that, good luck. Try googling Lambda calclus lectures on youtube.  
### Concrete Mathematics
[Specifically, this book.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201558025/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3H1VA8G9Y8XH1&coliid=I3GOFOCRW4FQQ0)  
### History of Computation

Electrical Engineering is a field unto itself and really big, but obviously intersects with computer science.  
### Hardware Design
[This](https://www.amazon.com/dp/012383872X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3H1VA8G9Y8XH1&coliid=I3VVBN46KFZVZN) is the book I see recommended the most.  
### Compiler Construction
[Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1558603204/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3H1VA8G9Y8XH1&coliid=I2SMKH5Q8K1O3A)  
[Writing Compilers and Interpreters: A Software Design Approach](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470177071/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3H1VA8G9Y8XH1&coliid=I3D540H0DBFSTR)

### Cyber Security
[Principles of Computer Security](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Computer-Security-Official-Comptia/dp/0071835970) is a good place to start. Read the book and do the labs, it's great.   
[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) is important to browse as well.   
### Mobile Development
[Have a look around this website for android.](https://developer.android.com/index.html)  
[Have a look here for IPhones.](https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/login?appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&path=%2Fdownload%2F&rv=1) Note that you have to have an Apple ID to access this site.  
### User Interface Design
[Specifically, User Interface Design for Programmers.](https://www.amazon.com/Interface-Design-Programmers-Avram-Spolsky/dp/1893115941)  
### Usability Design
[Smashing UX Design: Foundations for Designing Online User Experiences](https://www.amazon.com/Smashing-Design-Foundations-Designing-Experiences/dp/0470666854) is a pretty good choice for this.  
### Machine Learning
[Complex enough that you might wanna look at a textbook for it.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-machine-learning)  
Otherwise, just google around for tutorials for high-level libraries in languages like Python.
### Distributed Computing
[Distributed Computing: Fundamentals, Simulations, and Advanced Topics.](https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Computing-Fundamentals-Simulations-Advanced/dp/0471453242) Warning: This is a graduate-level book. You might be better off, once again, finding a framework for distributed computing and going with it. But if you want to design one of those frameworks, read this.  
### Web Servers
Apache and Nginx are the big two.  
[Nginx documetation here](http://nginx.org/en/docs/), and [Apache documentation here.](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/) Hack away and learn as much as you can through googling and documentation reading.  
### Front-End Web Development
Go to Langs.md here in this project and check out CSS, Javascript, and HTML. In the modern front-end world there are numerous frameworks to choose from. Visit Hackernews and look around at what people are blabbing about, and google for news and blog posts about frameworks from the last year or so. You'll find exactly what you need. 


I believe that it's possible to have a generalized knowledge of all of these things while focusing on a few as a specialty. That is my goal, with computer science both as a hobby and a career.

### Reading List
This is where I offer recommendations that fall outside the scope of the specific topics I presented, but are still very very useful to programmers and computer science nerds.

### General Education
As we know, it's usually a good idea to go to a college to get a well-rounded computer science education. Unfortunately, this sort of thing is not often available to the autodidact. So we have the next best thing linked here to get a foothold in CS.
[MIT Open Courseware.](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) So that there's nothing stopping you from getting a good education in CS. Go for it. Also consider using Kahn Academy for math.
