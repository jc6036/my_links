# Languages That Interest Me

## Languages I Have Learned
Definition of Learned here: I know the syntax and basics of the language, to the extent that I can go out and do research to figure out the things I need to do.  
I was going to have a section "Languages I'd like to Learn Better", but that's every single language I already know about, so it is what it is.

## Languages I Want to Learn
These languages I haven't even written a simple program in, and I probably don't even know the syntax.

## A Great Resource for Language Documentation
It's called DevDocs, and has only recently popped up. It has searchable documentation on many languages and APIs, and honestly   
it's suprising that something as great as this has taken so long to hit the front page of google!
